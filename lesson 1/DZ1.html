    <b><h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1></b>

    <h4><p>ACT 1</p></h4>
    
    <h4>PROLOGUE</h4>
   
<div class="text"><p>Two households, both alike in dignity,
    <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
    <p>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
    <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    <p>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
    <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,
    <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
        </p>

    <h4><p>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</p></h4>

    <br>

    
    <p>
        <i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        <h4>SAMPSON</h4>
     
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
       Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      <h4>GREGORY</h4>
    </p>

    <br>
    
   

    No, for then we should be colliers.
